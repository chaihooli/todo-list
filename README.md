## This program is developed as part of code-challenge named "TODO list"

###### Code Challenge2 : Build a todo list in javascript where a user can add a task, mark a task as completed & delete an already added task.

**To run the program: Open `index.html` in the browser**

###### Structure of files

1. Content of page is held in index.html
2. Styling of html elements is in style.css (with font from Google fonts) & also other fonts & icons are from font-awesome.css
3. All code logic for handling various scenarios is inside script.js file

###### My development environment:

1. Mac book pro.
2. Visual Studio Code 1.50.1
3. Google chrome 87.0
4. Using live-server to reflect the code-changes in real time, installation instructions here : https://gist.github.com/donmccurdy/20fb112949324c92c5e8
